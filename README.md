# python-api-challenge

For this challenge I created graphs from random cities and their weather. I used api keys from OpenWeatherMap and Google Places. 


Part 1:

I observed that
    
    The higher the latititude in the Northern Hemisphere the colder it gets. This is based on a strong negative correlation between the latitude and temperature.

    The lower the latititude in the Southern Hemisphere the colder it gets. This is based on a strong positive correlation between the latitude and temperature.

    The latitiude at 0 seems to be the warmest point, the meeting point of where the northern and southern hemispehre meet (the Equator). Both graphs show this.
    

Enjoy!
